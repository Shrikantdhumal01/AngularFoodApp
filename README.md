# AngularFoodApp
I undertook a project in Angular where I developed a food app.
This application utilized Angular framework along with Bootstrap for styling and JSON format for the database.
Notably, I opted to manually create the database rather than using MySQL or MongoDB. 
The application comprised essential features such as registration, login, search, add to cart, remove from cart,
and a comprehensive menu for food items.
During the development of this project, I encountered various challenges, particularly in cracking certain logic instances. 
Understanding and implementing the intricate logic required considerable time and effort.
To overcome these challenges, I resorted to utilizing memory diagrams and extensively sought assistance from online resources such as Google and YouTube. 
Through this process, I gained valuable insights into project flow and effectively utilized functional programming concepts like map, filter, and find functions.
